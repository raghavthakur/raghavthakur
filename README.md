# print("Hello World! 👋")
I'm Raghav, a backend software engineer with a history of building large-scale distributed systems at FAANG. I enjoy being involved with mentorship, hackathons, investing in tech stocks, and opportunities for growth. I'm highly motivated with a passion for learning, as they say with great passion comes great learning responsibility. Maybe not 😉 but I find this to be true. I have a deep curiosity of how things work and a desire to build tech, businesses, and knowledge.

Please reach out to me if you want to learn more about my experiences or want to have a chat.
