### print("Hello World! I'm Raghav ðŸ‘‹")
This might sound a little clichÃ© but I think I was born an engineer at heart. Growing up as a child I disassembled almost everything I could get my hands on, just to find out what made the thing tick! Sometimes leaving those things in pieces; may they rest in peace. I become fond of math, science, and art at an early age and developed those talents into a background in engineering and computer science. My source of inspiration growing up? Leonardo da Vinci.

I'm a software engineer at FAANG with a history of building full-stack web apps. I enjoy being involved with mentorship, helping aspiring software engineers, investing in tech stocks, and oppertunities for growth. I'm highly motivated with a passion  for learning, as they say with great passion comes great learning responsibility. Maybe not ðŸ˜‰, but I find this to be true. I have a curiosity of how things work and a desire to build things, perhaps even the possibility of going into space one day.
